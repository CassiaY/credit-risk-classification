## The Assignment  
In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. (Assignment prompt is found in [Project_2_Assignment.pdf](/Project_2_assignment.pdf))  

## The Process  
1. Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets:
    - imported the csv into a Pandas DataFrame
    - saved loan statuses in `y` label. (A value of 0 in the “loan_status” column means that the loan is healthy. A value of 1 means that the loan has a high risk of defaulting.)
    - saved the rest of the columns in `X` label.
    - split the data into training and testing datasets using `train_test_split`.
2. Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data:
    - fit the logsitic regression model with the training data.
    - fed the testing data to the model and saved the predictions.
    - evaluated the model's performance:  
        - confusion matrix:

        - classification report:

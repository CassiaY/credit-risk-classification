## Credit Risk Analysis Report  
### Overview of The Analysis
The purpose of this challenge was to take a dataset ([lending_data.csv](/Credit_Risk/Resources/lending_data.csv)) of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. (Assignment prompt is found in [Module_20_Challenge.pdf](/Module_20_Challenge.pdf)).   
- Sample of the data:  
![csv-sample](/readme_imgs/data_sample.png)  
A value of 0 in the “loan_status” column means that the loan is healthy.  
A value of 1 means that the loan has a high risk of defaulting.  

### Overview of The Process  
1. Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets:
    - imported the csv into a Pandas DataFrame
    - saved loan_status column in `y` label. 
    - saved the rest of the columns in `X` label.
    - split the data into training and testing datasets using `train_test_split`.
2. Created a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data:
    - fit the `LogsiticRegression` model with the training data.
    - fed the testing data to the fitted model and saved the predictions.
    - evaluated the model's performance using:  
        - confusion matrix:

        - classification report:  
            ![classification-report](/readme_imgs/classification_report.png)  

### Results
Logistic Regression Model Scores:
- Accuracy: 0.99
- Precision: 1.00 for loan status 0, 0.85 for loan status 1.
- Recall Scores:  0.99 for loan status 0, 0.91 for loan status 1.

### Summary
The logistic regression model has a strong accuracy (99%), as well as precision and recall for predicting both loan statuses. The precision and recall are higher with predicting healthy loans (100% precision and 99% recall) than high-risk loans (85% precision and 91% recall). This is indication that the model is likely to perform well in real life. However, it would be preferrable for the model to have higher scores for predicting high-risk loans rather than healthy loans from the lender's perspective.
